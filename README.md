# Yearbooks
This is an interactive, user-friendly networking platform we've developed to help connect alumni from various institutions and view yearbooks of different years.
It uses HTML-CSS and javascript frontend integrated with a django framework.
The web application offers a sign up option for first-time users and a login option for returning users. Upon signing in, a homepage curated with posts from the user's followers is displayed. Like, follow, comment options are provided for each user. There is a separate page to view yearbooks of various institutions sorted by year.
The search bar on the top left accepts user prompts and searches for similar usernames.
Each user can create their own profiles and add a bio, profile picture, workplace, alma maters and interests.
